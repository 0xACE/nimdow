# nimdow

A window manager written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)

**NOTE: This is a WIP and is not usable (yet).**

I am using this project to learn Nim, x11, and to replace my build of **dwm** (written in C).

## Building

`nimble build` for a quick development build

`nimble release` to create a release build
